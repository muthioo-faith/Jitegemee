        <h1>FORMAL SCHOOLING</h1>
        <P>Without some form of basic education, many street children have no hope for the future and end up dying on the pavement, victims of drugs, violent <br>
            crime, and disease. Jitegemee reaches out to street children and helps them return to school,Â giving them their childhoodsâ€”and futuresâ€”back.
        </P>
       
         <p>Â are committed to helping street children overcome all the obstacles that interfere with their success in schoolâ€”hunger, a lack of money for books<br>
             or school fees, embarrassment about inadequate clothing and shoes, and/or inadequate or non-existent social support.Â  Jitegemee strives to pay for<br>
              each year of a childâ€™s education, for as many levels as the child can attain.</p>

        <p>At a cost of roughly $100 per child per year, Jitegemee provides books, school uniforms, shoes, food, school and exam fees,Â tutoring, and emergency<br>
             medical care for former street children in elementary school. Many students are performing at the top of their class. At a cost of roughly $500 per child<br>
              per year, Jitegemee provides board, school fees, and tutoring for Jitegemee scholars who have earned admittance to the regionâ€™sÂ first- and second-<br>
              tier secondary schools.</p>
              <p>In addition,Â JitegemeeÂ supports a number of homeless elementary school-aged children in boarding schools as well as Jitegemee scholars who have <br>
                earned admittance to a university.</p>

        <h2>VOCATIONAL TRAINING</h2>
        <div class="sent">
        <p>When Kenya introduced free and compulsory education for children under the age of 14 inÂ 2003, manyÂ drop-in<br>
             centers for street childrenÂ closed, leaving no place for children over 14 to eat lunch and spend their days. Many of <br>
             these older children, too old for primary school, were forced back into the streets to face a bleak future.</p>
             <p>Recognizing that vulnerable childrenÂ were falling through the cracks,Â Jitegemee dramatically expanded our<br>
                 vocational program to support more teenage street children in becomingÂ self-sufficient.Â Our vocational training<br>
                  program, comprised of three phases, has achieved impressive results:</p>
             <p>Some 80 percent of our vocational graduates earn money from their trades.<br>

                About two-thirdsÂ ofÂ our graduates are now the primary breadwinners inÂ their homes.
                </p>
                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Phase One</h3>
                    <p>Jitegemeeâ€™s vocational students start with a six-month pre-vocational rehabilitation program.Â The curriculum covers basic math and literacy,<br>
                         business education, communication skills, and self-esteem and â€œliving valuesâ€ education. The program emphasizes punctuality, honesty, <br>
                         cleanliness, and the importance of giving back to the community. The first phase ends with a week-long workshop for vocational students and their<br>
                          guardians that introduces them to a variety of trades. The workshops are conducted by qualified tradespeople with the assistance of the Undugu Society <br>
                        of Kenya, a well-respected organization with a successful vocational program in Nairobi.</p>
                <div class="phase2">
                 <h3>Phase Two</h3>
                 <p>In phase two, Jitegemee’s vocational students are placed in a one- to two-year apprenticeship program where they learn a life-changing trade of their <br>
                    choosing, such as carpentry, welding, electronics, hair-dressing, and tailoring. As apprentices to local tradespeople, students learn their trade and the <br>
                    folkways that govern professional behavior. Many students also earn a commission. During this phase,Â the vocational students continue to meet every <br>
                    day for a hearty lunch, as well weekly with Jitegemee staff for continued business skills training, â€œliving valuesâ€ education, computer training, and <br>
                    social support. At the conclusion of phase two, Jitegemee provides additional tuition to students who are ready to take the Government Trade<br>
                     Examination, level 3, and covers the cost of any examination fees.

                </div>
                <div class="phase3">
                    <h3>Phase Three</h3>
                    <p>Once the apprenticeshipÂ is completed, Jitegemee provides vocational graduates with the helpÂ they need to go into business for themselves. Each<br>
                         graduate receives a set of start-up tools, and as they begin to earn money from their trades, Jitegemee staff members assist them with savingÂ money to<br>
                          purchase their own tools. When they are established in their trades, theyÂ teach the skills they have mastered to the next generation of Jitegemee <br>
                          vocational students.

                <h2>SOCIAL SUPPORT</h2>
                <div class="senti">
                    <p>JitegemeeÂ is determinedÂ to provide theÂ social support our studentsÂ wereÂ deprived of when they <br>
                        ended upÂ in the streets.Â This social support is critical to keeping themÂ in school even in the most <br>
                        difficult of circumstances. It includesÂ a sense of belonging, genuine caring among community members, a <br>
                        sense of pride and self-accomplishment, and mutual respect and acceptance.

                    </p>
                    <p>Jitegemee’s programming focuses on building social support and self-esteem by giving themÂ the<br>
                         opportunity toÂ give back to their communities and other destitute children. Students are frequently asked <br>
                         to reflect on how they contribute, and what would enable them to play a larger role in helping others.</p>
                         <p>Other ways Jitegemee provides social support include:</p>
                         <p>Providing daily breakfast and lunch where students can come together as a community.<br>

                            Hosting an Annual Childrenâ€™s Day to recognize our students’ achievements.<br>

                            OfferingÂ tutoringÂ after school and during school breaks.<br>

                            Providing guidance and counseling.</p>

                <div class="sentii">
                    <p>OrganizingÂ internships for secondary students during school breaks at local hospitals, businesses, and government offices.<br>

                        Organizing motivational speakers and visitors to inspire students to dream big.<br>

                        Providing HIV/AIDS education, yearly medical screening, and emergency health care.<br>

                        OrganizingÂ educational field trips to national sights across Kenya, includingÂ overnight camping trips to Mombasa, Nakuru, and Naivasha, <br>
                        introducing them to Kenyaâ€™s natural wonders.<br>

                    <h3>Youth Hub</h3>
                    <p>Jitegemee’s Youth Development hub is a program that tackles youth unemployment and underemployment by building the capacity of vulnerable young <br>
                        people in our community. The program runs for nine months and focuses on life skills as well as technical skills training. We believe that with this kind of<br>
                         training, our students will have the ability to take advantage of the opportunities in the market. This scenario will enhance improved levels of income that will<br>
                          positively contribute to enhanced livelihoods in our community.</p>
