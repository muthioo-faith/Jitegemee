        <p>Asante sana, Thank you to our Donors and Partners for your generous support!<br>

            We are grateful for every donation, no matter how small or big, as it is our community of donors that makes our work possible. Over the past five<br>
             years, we have had 540 individual donors generously support our work, giving generously at our events, online fundraisers, or in response to our<br>
              mailings.</p>
              <p>We extend a special thanks to Segal Family Foundation for their ongoing support that goes far beyond our multi-year grant. We are also <br>
                delighted to currently have grant support from Elma Foundation and the United Nations Development Programmeâ€™s Small Grants Programme.</p>
