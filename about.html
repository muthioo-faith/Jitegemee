    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Jitegemee’s mission is to provide educational and integrated support services for vulnerable children and youth in Machakos, Kenya. We work to remove
         the obstacles of poverty that prevent children from attaining their educational goals. Our child-centered holistic programming includes school support, 
         vocational and livelihoods training for youth and their caregivers, healthcare and education, and psycho-social support. We are committed to helping our
          young people gain decent employment, live dignified lives, and contribute to their community.</p>
